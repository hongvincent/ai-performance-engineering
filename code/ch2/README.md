# Chapter 2: GPU Hardware Architecture

## Overview

Understanding your hardware is critical for effective optimization. This chapter provides deep insight into NVIDIA GPU architecture, helping you make informed decisions about which optimizations have the biggest impact. Learn about the memory hierarchy, NVLink interconnect, and CPU-GPU coherency models.

## Learning Objectives

After completing this chapter, you can:

- [OK] Understand NVIDIA GPU architecture and specifications
- [OK] Measure and validate hardware capabilities (HBM3e bandwidth, NVLink throughput)
- [OK] Identify hardware bottlenecks in your workloads
- [OK] Understand CPU-GPU coherency and when to use zero-copy memory
- [OK] Make architecture-aware optimization decisions

## Prerequisites

**Previous chapters**: [Chapter 1: Performance Basics](../ch1/README.md) - profiling fundamentals

**Hardware**: 8x NVIDIA GPU or NVIDIA GPUs (examples adaptable to other architectures)

## Examples

### 1. `hardware_info.py` - GPU Introspection

**Purpose**: Programmatically query and display GPU specifications.

**What it shows**:
- GPU name, compute capability, memory size
- SM (Streaming Multiprocessor) count
- Memory bandwidth specifications
- Thread block limits

**How to run**:
```bash
python3 hardware_info.py
```

**Expected output (NVIDIA GPU)**:
```
GPU 0: NVIDIA GPU
  Compute Capability: 10.0  (NVIDIA GPU)
  SMs: 148
  Global Memory: 180 GB (HBM3e)
  Memory Bandwidth: 8 TB/s (theoretical)
  Max threads per block: 1024
  Warp size: 32
```

**Key specs to remember**:
- **180 GB HBM3e** (not 192GB - common misconception!)
- **148 SMs** (not 192 - another common error)
- **8 TB/s** theoretical bandwidth (realistically achieve 30-40%)

### 2. `nvlink_c2c_p2p_blackwell.cu` - NVLink Bandwidth Test

**Purpose**: Measure peer-to-peer (P2P) bandwidth between GPUs via NVLink.

**What it demonstrates**:
- P2P memory access enablement
- Unidirectional and bidirectional bandwidth measurement
- NVLink vs PCIe comparison

**How to run**:
```bash
make
./nvlink_c2c_p2p_blackwell
```

**Expected output**:
```
Testing P2P bandwidth between GPU 0 and GPU 1
Unidirectional (GPU 0 -> GPU 1): 250 GB/s
Bidirectional (simultaneous):     450 GB/s
```

**Performance targets (NVIDIA GPU)**:
- **NVLink 5.0**: 250+ GB/s unidirectional per link
- **Bidirectional**: 450+ GB/s (with proper overlap)
- **AllReduce (NCCL)**: 273.5 GB/s measured (excellent!)

**Why this matters**: Multi-GPU training/inference depends on fast GPU-to-GPU communication. NVLink is 10x+ faster than PCIe.

---

### 3. `gb200_grace_blackwell_coherency.cu` - CPU-GPU Coherency

**Purpose**: Demonstrate cache-coherent memory access between Grace CPU and NVIDIA GPU.

**What it demonstrates**:
- Zero-copy memory allocation (CPU-GPU coherent)
- Performance comparison: zero-copy vs explicit transfers
- When coherency helps vs hurts

**How to run** (NVIDIA GPU only):
```bash
make
./gb200_coherency
```

**Expected behavior**:
- **Small transfers (<1MB)**: Zero-copy wins (no transfer overhead)
- **Large transfers (>10MB)**: Explicit H2D wins (dedicated memory faster)

**Key insight**: CPU-GPU coherency eliminates small transfer overhead but isn't a replacement for device memory for large data.

---

### 4. `cpu_gpu_topology_aware.py` - CPU-GPU Topology

**Purpose**: Query and display CPU-GPU topology for any system architecture (NVIDIA GPU, NVIDIA GPU, GH200, etc.).

**What it shows**:
- CPU architecture and NUMA topology
- GPU architecture detection (NVIDIA GPU, NVIDIA GPU Ultra modern compute capability, Hopper, etc.)
- CPU-GPU interconnect type (NVLink-C2C, PCIe Gen4/5, etc.)
- NUMA node assignments and GPU affinity

**How to run**:
```bash
python3 cpu_gpu_topology_aware.py
```

**Expected output**:
```
GPU Topology:
  GPU 0 <-> GPU 1: NVLink (9 links)
  GPU 0 <-> GPU 4: NVSwitch
  GPU 0 <-> CPU:   PCIe Gen5
```

**Why this matters**: Affects multi-GPU scaling in Chapter 4. GPUs within same NVSwitch domain communicate faster.

## Hardware Architecture Deep Dive

### NVIDIA GPU Specifications

| Component | Specification | Notes |
|-----------|--------------|-------|
| Architecture | NVIDIA GPU (modern compute capability) | 10.0 compute capability |
| SMs | 148 | ~19,000 CUDA cores |
| Memory | 180 GB HBM3e | NOT 192 GB! |
| Memory Bandwidth | 8 TB/s | Theoretical; 30-40% achievable |
| FP32 | 2000 TFLOPS (sparse) | Dense: ~1000 TFLOPS |
| FP16/BF16 | 2000 TFLOPS | With Tensor Cores |
| FP8 | 4000 TFLOPS | Transformer Engine |
| INT8 | 8000 TOPS | Inference |
| TDP | 1000W | Per GPU |

### Memory Hierarchy

```
        Fastest
           ↑
    [Registers] ← 65,536 per SM
           ↑
  [L1/Shared Memory] ← 256 KB per SM (configurable split)
           ↑
      [L2 Cache] ← 192 MB (shared across SMs)
           ↑
     [HBM3e Memory] ← 180 GB @ 8 TB/s
           ↑
    [NVLink/NVSwitch] ← GPU-GPU: 250+ GB/s
           ↑
      [System RAM] ← CPU-GPU: ~64 GB/s (PCIe Gen5)
        Slowest
```

**Optimization implication**: Minimize trips down the hierarchy. Keep hot data in registers/shared memory (Chapters 7-9).

### CPU-GPU (NVIDIA GPU) Additions

**Grace CPU**: 72-core ARM Neoverse V2  
**Chip-to-Chip (C2C) Link**: 900 GB/s coherent interconnect  
**Unified Memory**: CPU and GPU share coherent address space  

**When to use**:
- [OK] Small, frequent CPU-GPU transfers
- [OK] Irregular memory access patterns
- ERROR: Large bulk transfers (use explicit H2D)
- ERROR: GPU-only compute (standard NVIDIA GPU is fine)

## Performance Analysis

### Measuring Your Hardware

Use the common profiling tools:

```bash
# Check GPU specs
python3 hardware_info.py

# Benchmark NVLink
make
./nvlink_c2c_p2p_blackwell

# Verify NVLink with NCCL (Chapter 4)
python3 ../ch4/nccl_benchmark.py
```

### Expected Baselines (NVIDIA GPU)

| Metric | Target | Typical Achievable | Excellent |
|--------|--------|-------------------|-----------|
| HBM3e Bandwidth | 8 TB/s | 2.7 TB/s (34%) | 40% |
| FP16 Compute | 2000 TFLOPS | 1000 TFLOPS (50%) | 65% |
| NVLink P2P | 250 GB/s | 230 GB/s (92%) | 95% |
| NVLink AllReduce | N/A | 273 GB/s | Validated [OK] |

**Reality check**: 40-60% of theoretical peak is EXCELLENT for real workloads. Memory-bound ops (most models) won't hit compute peaks.

## How to Run All Examples

```bash
cd ch2

# Install Python dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Query GPU info
python3 hardware_info.py

# Build CUDA examples
make

# Test NVLink bandwidth
./nvlink_c2c_p2p_blackwell

# NVIDIA GPU only: Test coherency
./gb200_coherency  # Only on NVIDIA GPU systems

# Check topology (works with any CPU-GPU architecture)
python3 cpu_gpu_topology_aware.py
```

## Key Takeaways

1. **Know your specs**: NVIDIA GPU has 180 GB (not 192) and 148 SMs (not 192). Using wrong specs leads to incorrect performance expectations.

2. **Memory bandwidth is the bottleneck**: Most models are memory-bound. HBM3e bandwidth (8 TB/s) matters more than compute (2000 TFLOPS) for large models.

3. **40% is great**: Don't expect to hit 100% of theoretical peaks. 40-60% is excellent for real workloads.

4. **NVLink is critical for multi-GPU**: 250+ GB/s vs ~64 GB/s over PCIe. Multi-GPU scaling depends on it (Chapter 4).

5. **CPU-GPU coherency is nuanced**: Great for small transfers, not a replacement for device memory.

6. **Architecture awareness informs optimization**: Knowing the memory hierarchy helps you choose which optimizations to prioritize (Chapters 7-10).

## Common Pitfalls

### Pitfall 1: Wrong Spec Expectations
**Problem**: Expecting 192 GB memory or 192 SMs based on older or different SKUs.

**Reality**: NVIDIA GPU has 180 GB and 148 SMs. Check your actual hardware!

### Pitfall 2: Comparing to Theoretical Peak
**Problem**: "My code only achieves 30% of peak compute, it must be slow!"

**Reality**: Most workloads are memory-bound. 30-40% of peak is normal and good.

### Pitfall 3: Assuming P2P is Automatic
**Problem**: P2P access must be explicitly enabled with `cudaDeviceEnablePeerAccess()`.

**Solution**: Always enable P2P before multi-GPU work. PyTorch/NCCL do this automatically.

### Pitfall 4: Overusing Zero-Copy on NVIDIA GPU
**Problem**: Using CPU-GPU coherency for large data transfers.

**Reality**: Explicit `cudaMemcpy` is faster for bulk transfers (>10MB). Use zero-copy for small, frequent accesses only.
